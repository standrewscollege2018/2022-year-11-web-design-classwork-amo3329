    <!-- Intro section -->
    <p><h1>Italy</h1></p>
    <p>We struck Italy in the middle of a heatwave, yet still loved exploring the famous sights.</p>
    <!-- Venice section -->
    <p><h2>Venice</h2></p>
    <img src="assets/images/venice.jpg" alt="Picture of Venice">
    <p>Venice, while crowded with tourists and a little smelly in places, is still an amazing place to visit.<br>
      You need to get yourself lost in all the narrow streets and canals, and enjoy the hospitality of those few locals still left living on the island.</p>
    <!-- Amalfi section -->
    <p><h2>Amalfi</h2></p>
    <img src="assets/images/amalfi.jpg" alt="Picture of Amalfi">
    <p>Amalfi is another one of those famous places you will see in thousands of photos but still have your breath taken away when you experience it first-hand.</p>
    <p>Another thing that can take your breath away is the insanely crowded, narrow and winding roads! Still, it is so beautiful that it is worth the driving stress.</p>
    <!-- Leaning Tower of Pisa section -->
    <p><h2>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2></p>
    <img src="assets/images/pisa.jpg" alt="Picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa">
    <p>Marvel at all the tourists taking the obligatory photo of themselves "holding up" the famous tower!</p>
    <p>Interestingly, there was a failed terrorist plot to topple the tower the same day we were visiting.</p>
    <!-- Rome section -->
    <p><h2>Rome</h2></p>
    <p>What would any trip to Italy be without a visit to the Eternal City, Rome?</p>
    <img src="assets/images/coliseum.jpg" alt="Picture of the Colosseum">
    <p>The Colosseum is one of the most iconic sights in the world, and you feel like you have travelled back in time when you stand inside the towering stadium.</p>
